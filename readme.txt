This plugin has been written to insert an Author introduction to each post, based on its post Author and their bio etc.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you the ability to add a Author introduction to each post. No editing of themes is required to use the plugin and a default layout is set up on install. Play with the html layout until you get exactly what you want. A number of tags are provided to give you access to the Author data *[authorID], [authorDisplayName], [authoremail], [authorURL], [authorPostsLink], [authorGravatar]* and *[authorBio]* also optionally you can use php if you are an advanced user. 

Tags are evaluated first, then php before the results are returned.
